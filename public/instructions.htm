      <h3>Task: Scoring Image</h3>
      
      On the next pages, you will be asked to score a series of <em>at
      least</em> <strong id="nimages">_</strong> and <em>at
      most</em> <strong id="nimages_highbound">_</strong> images:

      <ul>
        <li>
          you need to score at least <em id="nimages2">_</em> images,
          so that you can gain experience in making
          <strong>relative</strong> comparisons;
        </li>

        <li>
          you cannot score more
          than <em id="nimages_highbound2">_</em> images, because we
          want to collect assessments from multiple people.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You will only be compensated if you complete at least the
        minimum number of image scores.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Scientific Research</h3>

      <p>
        The images you are asked to score have been created by human
        subjects participating in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure the integrity of this scientific research, please
        try to be as accurate as possible in your assessments.
      </p>

    </div>
      
    <div id="instructions2" style="display:none;">

      <h3>Scoring Scale</h3>
  
      Score each image by moving a slider on a scale
      from <strong>0</strong> (lowest grade) to <strong>10</strong>
      (highest grade) on four dimensions:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Interestingness as a face</li>
        <li>Abstractness</li>
        <li>Overall appeal or quality </li>                
      </ul>
      
      <!-- In your evaluation, <strong>do not</strong> consider the color of the lines, but just the shapes and figures they form. -->
      
      <h3>How the images have been created</h3>
      
      Each image has been created in <em>less than 60 seconds</em>
      using a special computer interface. This interface is designed
      to draw images quickly, but with some limitations. <br/><br/>
      
      You will see a random sample of the created images in the next
      page.      
      
    </div>
    
    <div id="sample" style="display:none;">
      <h2>Random Sample of Images</h2>
      <h4>Remember: the images were created by human subjects during a scientific study.</h4>

      <p>
        Please take some time to review the images carefully.
        
        <p>
          In this task, you are asked to assess not the absolute
          quality, but
          <strong>relative</strong> to other images created in the
          same task. We show you these samples to give you a sense of
          the images you will see.
        </p>

        When you are done, but not before the timer reaches 00:00,
        click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the
        page.<br/><br/><br/>
