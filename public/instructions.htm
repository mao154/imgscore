      <h3>Task: Scoring Image</h3>
      
      In the next pages, you will be asked to score a series
      of <em id="nimages">_</em> images.
      
      <p>
        All the images in this task have been created by human
        subjects participating in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. To
        guarantee the correctness of scientific research, please try
        to be as much accurate as possible.
      </p>
      
      Score each image by moving a slider on a scale from 0 (lowest
      grade) to 10 (highest grade) on four dimensions:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Interestingness as a face</li>
        <li>Abstractness</li>
        <li>Overall appealing or quality </li>                
      </ul>
      
      <!-- In your evaluation, <strong>do not</strong> consider the color of the lines, but just the shapes and figures they form. -->
      
      <h3>How the images have been created</h3>
      
      Each image has been created in less than 60 seconds using a
      special computer interface. This interface is designed to draw
      images quickly, but with some limitations. <br/><br/>
      
      You will see a random sample of the created images in the next
      page.

      <h2>Random Sample of Images</h2>
      <h4>Remember: the images were created by human subjects during a scientific study.</h4>
      <p>
        Please take some time to review the images carefully.  <br/>
        
        When the timer reaches 00:00, click on the "Next" button at the
        bottom of the page to start the task.<br/><br/><br/>
