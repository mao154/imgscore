       <h3>Image Ranking</h3>

       In the next pages you will be shown a series of <em>40</em> images. 
      
      <p>
        The images have been created by human subjects participating in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. For the correctness of scientific research, please try to be as much accurate as possible.
      </p>
      
      You will be asked to rank each image by moving a slider on a scale from 0 (lowest grade) to 10 (highest grade) on four dimensions:

      <ul>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Interestingness as a face</li>
        <li>Abstractness</li>
        <li>Overall appealing or quality </li>                
      </ul>

      In your evaluation, <strong>do not</strong> consider the color of the lines, but just the shapes and figures they form.

      <h3>How the images have been created</h3>
      
      Each image has been created in 60 seconds time by human subjects using a semi-automated, parametric tool.
      <br/><br/>
      This tool allows to draw images quickly, but imposes limitations in the types of shapes that is possible to draw.
      <br/><br/>      
      You will get a better idea of the possibilities offered by the tool by observing a random sample of images in the next page.
      
       <h3>Go ahead</h3>

        Please take some time to observe the images carefully before starting tagging them.
        <br/><br/>
        When ready click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the page.
