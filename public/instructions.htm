      <h3>Task: Scoring Image</h3>
      
      <p>
        On the next pages, you will be asked to score a series of
        images. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Image scoring is done in <strong>sets</strong>. Each set
        contains <strong id="nimages">_</strong> images, and you:
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            need to score at
            least <strong id="sets_lowbound">_</strong> <span id="set_plural">set</span>,
            so that you can gain experience in making
            <em>relative comparisons</em>;
          </li>
          
          <li>
            cannot score more
            than <strong id="sets_highbound">_</strong> sets, because
            we want to collect assessments from <em>multiple
            people</em>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Important! You need to <em>fully</em> complete each set that
        you have started in order to get compensated.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Scientific Research</h3>

      <p>
        The images you are asked to score have been created by human
        subjects participating in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure the integrity of this scientific research, please
        try to be as accurate as possible in your assessments.
      </p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>

      <h3>Scoring Scale</h3>
  
      Score each image on a scale
      from <strong id="grade_lowest">_</strong> (lowest grade)
      to <strong id="grade_highest">_</strong> (highest grade) on the
      following dimensions:
      
      <ul id="dimensions_list"></ul>
      
      <!-- In your evaluation, <strong>do not</strong> consider the color of the lines, but just the shapes and figures they form. -->
      
      <h3>How the images have been created</h3>
      
      Each image has been created in <em>less than 60 seconds</em>
      using a special computer interface. This interface is designed
      to draw images quickly, but with some limitations. <br/><br/>
      
      You will see a random sample of the created images on the next
      page.
      
    </div>
    
    <div id="sample" style="display:none;">
      <h2>Random Sample of Images</h2>
      <h4>Remember: the images were created by human subjects during a scientific study.</h4>

      <p>
        Please take some time to review the images carefully.
        
        <p>
          Important! You are asked to assess <strong>not</strong> the
          "absolute quality," but rather how they score
          <strong>relative</strong> to the other images created in the
          same task. The sample below should give you a sense of the
          images you will see.
        </p>

        When you are done, but not before the timer reaches 00:00,
        click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the
        page.<br/><br/><br/>
        
        <span id="doneTimer"></span>

    <br/>
    <button class="btn btn-info" id="doneButton">Next</button>
  </div>
