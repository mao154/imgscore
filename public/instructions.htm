       <h3>Image Ranking</h3>

       In the next pages you will be shown a series of <em>40</em> images.
      
      <p>
        The images have been created by human subjects participating
        in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. For the correctness of
        scientific research, please try to be as much accurate as
        possible.
      </p>
      
      Rank each image by moving a slider on a scale from 0 (lowest
      grade) to 10 (highest grade) on four dimensions:

      <ul>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Interestingness as a face</li>
        <li>Abstractness</li>
        <li>Overall appealing or quality </li>                
      </ul>

      <!-- In your evaluation, <strong>do not</strong> consider the color of the lines, but just the shapes and figures they form. -->

      <h3>How the images have been created</h3>
      
      Each image has been created in less than 60 seconds by human
      subjects using a special computer interface. <br/><br/>

      This interface allowed them to draw images quickly, but imposed
      limitations on the images that could be created. <br/><br/>

      Get a better idea of the possibilities offered by the tool by
      looking at a random sample of images in the next page.

        Please take some time to observe the images carefully.
