       <h3>Image categorization</h3>

       In the next pages you will be shown a series of <em>50-60</em> images. 
      
      <p>
        The images have been created by human subjects participating in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. For the correctness of scientific research, please try to be as much accurate as possible.
      </p>
      
      You will be asked to express a quality judgement on each image by moving a slider on a scale from 0 to 10,  where:
      <ul>
        <li> 0 (zero) means <em>complete dislike</em> </li>
        <li> 5 (five) means that you are <em>indifferent</em> </li>
        <li> 10 (ten) means <em>complete like</em> </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Parametric images</h3>
      
      What the subject could draw was limited by the parametric tool used to generate the images. You will get a better idea of the possibilities offered by the tool by observing a random sample of pictures in the next page. Please take into account the limitations of the tool when expressing your judgement.
