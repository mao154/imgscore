       <h3>Image categorization</h3>

       In the next pages you will be shown a series of <em>50-60</em> images. 
      
      <p>
        The images have been generated with a computer software by human subjects participating in a <em>scientific experiment</em>. For the correctness of scientific research, please try to be as much accurate as possible.
      </p>

      You are asked to assign each image to one of the following four categories:
      <dl id="instrcat">
        <dt>Human face:</dt>
        <dd>An image resembling a human face. Some traits can be missing, or be slightly distorted, or the face might look overall more like a caricature, or a cartooned version of a face.</dd>

        <dt>Non-human face:</dt>
        <dd>An image having some, or all, the characteristic traits of a face, but so distorted, or out of the normal positions (for example with the mouth above the eyes), that it cannot be human. For example, fantasy, animal, or alien faces would rather fit here than in the category above.</dd>

        <dt>Any other known object or shape:</dt>
        <dd>An image resembling a known object or shape, but not a face. For example, a car, a kitchen tool, or a full body - containing a face - would belong to this category. The image does not need to be a close representation of the object, but can just remind it.</dd>

        <dt>Abstract lines:</dt>
        <dd>An image not belonging to any of the categories above goes here.</dd>

      </dl>
      
       <h3>Tags</h3>

      <p>
      Additionally, you can also type some words (tags) describing the salient features of the image. Good tags help to distinguish groups of similar images within the <em style="text-decoration:underline;">same</em> category.
      <br/>
       If you have used a tag in one image, please be consistent and use the same tags for all images containig the same salient feature.
      </p>
